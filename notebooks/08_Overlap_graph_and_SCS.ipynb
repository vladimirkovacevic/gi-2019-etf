    "As shown in the lecture slides one way would be taking minimal prefix of the second string, and searching for it in the first string (from left to right). Logic behind this is that longer the overlap, (minimal) prefix of the second string will be more to the left in the first string.\n",

After we find it, instead of doing extension case-by-case in both of the strings, we check if suffix of the first string starting with this occurence is prefix of the second string. If answer if yes, this means we've found the longest prefix. If answer is no, we search (to the right) for the next occurence of minimal prefix in the first string. If we don't find any suffix of the first string (starting with minimal prefix of the second string), which is the prefix of the second string, this means that overlap of the two strings is not-existent for given conditions.
